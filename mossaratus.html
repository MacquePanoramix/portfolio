        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
  Mossaratus is a <strong>horde movement shooter</strong> where players
  <strong>alternate between fighting waves of monsters and visiting the shop to buy new guns</strong>.
  It was created as part of the course <strong>Interactive Media Development</strong>,
  together with three very good teammates.
</p>

<p>
  In Mossaratus, you play as a robot exploring a mossy cave when you are suddenly ambushed by monsters.
  Your job becomes clearing them out so you can continue your exploration.
  The game is presented in a CRT-inspired aesthetic. You alternate between wiping out each wave of enemies
  and using the money they drop to buy items at the shop.
  We were able to implement all the core features we envisioned for the game,
  although with more time it would always have been possible to add more content.

  <h3>Core experience</h3>
  <p>
    I feel quite proud of how our game was received during the testing days.
    Not everyone wanted to play for very long, which is fine, because it wasn’t
    really made for everyone. However, for the people who did enjoy this style
    of game, we noticed they got really into it. Some players replayed the game
    countless times, which is exactly what we were hoping for.

        <article class="project-highlight">
  <h3>My contribution</h3>
  <p>
    I was responsible for setting up the backbone of the shop system and for
    fully modelling and implementing the boss. Due to a short testing period,
    the boss fight ended up being harder than we had planned, but I was still
    very satisfied with the aesthetics of the boss and how it fought. Even
    though the difficulty is something we would have adjusted if we had more
    time, it still created interesting experiences for the players who decided
    to take on the challenge and try to beat it.

        <article class="project-highlight">
  <h3>What I learned</h3>
  <p>
    In this case, I actually learned more from what went right than from what
    went wrong, because the project went about as well as I could have hoped.
    I gained a lot of comfort and confidence using Unity and Blender, especially
    when working with animations.
